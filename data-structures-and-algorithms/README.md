# reason-examples

Examples for the Reason programming language. https://reasonml.github.io/

Currently unit tests are written in JavaScript using Jest.

At some point it may be worth looking into bs-jest https://github.com/glennsl/bs-jest so they can be written in Reason/BuckleScript.

Or potentially look at OUnit http://ounit.forge.ocamlcore.org/ and write them in Reason/OCaml.
